<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
ScoutCraft was, during Corona, the place for Dutch Scouts to meet each other and make new friends. On the Minecraft server and in the Discord community about 5000 scouts spent over 150.000 hours. As the projects stops, after exactly 3 years, on 28 april 2023, we decided to make a lot of our resources available, as is. This file is an overview of what we have available and links to all our different repositories.

## Maintenance
As the ScoutCraft project has officially ended, we don't update our resources anymore on regular basis. That said, we do monitor the repositories and are open for PR's and issues. If an issue is critical, we will look into a solution. If you want to do more development and change the plugins, you need to make a fork. As we use this as an archive. We will mention forks with great improvements, such as new features, new maps, etcetera. If you think your fork should be mentioned, send us an email!

## Our resources
In the last 3 years, we made a lot of resources for Minecraft servers, such as: plugins and minigames with maps, configs for lots of different plugins and Discord bots. We split it up in a few repositories. All our plugin's and minigames have there own repository, our configs are bundled in one repository, our maps are also bundled in one repository. Our worlds are distributed externally. See the category for more information.

### Plugins
All our self made plugins have their own repository. Here you can find all the information you need to run this plugins on there own. Our best or most useful plugins have a easy to run version which is almost drag and drop. Most of our minigames also have a maps, which you can find in the maps repository. The following plugins are available.

- PillowFight
- Levend Statego
- Werewolves
- Eagle
- Geocache
- Hangman
- PresentHunt
- Lodge

### Servers
We made many servers with lots of configs for plugins and server software. For most of our servers, you can find the files we used to setup here. Most of this configs were updated and fine tuned while monitored in production for months or even years. So you can be sure they are well-tested. You can download the servers as a zip file externally. Per server is explained whats comes with your download. All downloads have a `TODO.txt` file in the zip. Here you can find what you have to change to run them on your own system.

Some of our servers come without a map, because the map was to big or we thought it would be better to start the server with a new world. All the maps are also downloadable.

#### Proxy
As proxy we used a waterfall server which made it possible to connect all our servers.
